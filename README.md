### Real-Life Car Counter  

This project is a **real-life car counter** that utilizes **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, **OpenCV**, and **CVZone** to detect and count cars in real-time from video feeds or recordings. It can be deployed in applications like traffic management, parking lot monitoring, and vehicle statistics collection.

---

## 🚀 Features  

- **Real-Time Car Detection**: Uses YOLO for fast and accurate object detection.  
- **Count Cars Automatically**: Counts the number of cars in a specific area of interest.  
- **Region of Interest (ROI) Setup**: Allows configuration of the area to monitor and count vehicles.  
- **Frame-by-Frame Visualization**: Displays the detection and counting process in real-time.  
- **Supports Video Input**: Works with live camera feeds or pre-recorded video files.  
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Adjust detection parameters to fit specific environments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **YOLO**: For object detection.  
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and video handling.  
- **CVZone**: For simplifying computer vision tasks.  
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
